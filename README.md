This simple Battleship game which is basically a starting point to hopefully
end with a decent game! 

Ideally would like to end up with a board and various different
battleships even submarines and i may get slightly adventurious and add some kind of sonar
to test if a battleship is near where the player placed the sonar(Idea from a battlehip game
I played when i was a nipper!). By the end of the development it would be great to maybe even add
graphics on the screen!

First battleship game consists of one battle ship and an array of 5 elements, boat is 3 unit long and randomly 
placed in the 5 blick array. Player guesses where the boat is and when all the boat has been destroyed the game will end.

Game now consist of a 7 x 7 grid (virtual) and 3 boats names "Destroyer, Cruiser and LightWeight". As before player guesses 
until all boats have been hit and sunk, and a message at the end stating how well the player performed!

Issues to work on:

The ability of the player to select outside the grid!

The player if you hit the boat and play the same coordinate again will show as a miss!
